        Aseries of punishing droughts set the stage for the Syrian civil war in 2011. A drying East Africa fuels ongoing
        conflicts over natural resources in Somalia and Kenya. Rising seas threaten future refugee crises in Southeast
        Asia. Melting sea ice in the Arctic is opening new shipping lanes, creating new potential for tensions among
        competing powers at the top of the world.

        These are among the many worries – some already realized and some forecast in the near future – that concern
        experts studying the convergence of climate change and national security.

        The idea that a warming planet threatens stability around the globe is not a new one. The U.S. Naval War College
        began studying the topic as early as the late 1980s, and over the past three decades a steady stream of analyses
        from the U.S. Defense Department, private think tanks, and other organizations have pointed to threats that
        climate change poses to peace and stability. Climate change is rarely viewed as a direct cause of instability
        and conflict, but experts generally regard it as a “threat multiplier” – a phenomenon that can worsen or
        exacerbate other sources of instability and conflict, such as competition for natural resources and ethnic
        tensions.
